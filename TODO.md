# TO DO

Try using Ocaml for some of the solutions.

Solve Problems 1 - 10 with Python.

Introduce C/C++/Java solutions to Problems 3 - 10

Rewrite Makefiles? 

Optimize Solutions/Clean Code:
P10: runs super slow.

P7: Finish cpp version with forward list, nested iterators. Get python
working too, and then run compare script to log times. So far C feels much
faster than Java.

prime problems: use Iterator on C++/Java

Write a list structure for C, maybe other languages too.

Need more data structures and stuff

Need to go through problem 3 solutions. Maybe try an actual
factorization method rather than BFS/ 
Java/C++/Python not sure if work. 

Problem 3: Write a subroutine that returns two factors of a number
in the form of a list of lists. Then recursively go through each element, 
sending it back to this subroutine until it can't be factored anymore. Then we know
these factors are prime. Store the prime factors in a small - ish list. Search for largest
in list. Much better solution.
