# Project Euler

Background
==========
This is just a fun little project from this [page.](https://projecteuler.net)

Each Solution to each problem is written in 4 languages:
- C
- C++
- Java
- Python

The Solutions are stored in directories named after each problem, and then after each language.
To run the individual language solutions, move into its directory, and run **test.sh**
$ ./test.sh

If you'd prefer to compare the time it takes each solution to solve, in each problem directory there
is a bash script called **compare-times.sh**, so just run it.
$ ./compare-times.sh
It'll write a text file called **compare-times.txt** that will hold the time for each language.
