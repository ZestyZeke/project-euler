# Project Euler

## Contributors: Zeke Reyna, Moses Franco

This is just a fun little project from this [page.](https://projecteuler.net)

To run any of the solutions, go into each folder and run:
$ ./runplz

I have a bash script called runplz that compiles, executes and cleans
each folders' source files.
